Before starting, discover project context:

**Project instructions:** Read `./CLAUDE.md` if it exists in the working directory. Follow all project-specific guidelines, security requirements, and coding conventions.

**Project skills:** Check `.agents/skills/` directory if it exists:
1. List available skills (subdirectories)
2. Read `SKILL.md` for each skill (lightweight index ~130 lines)
3. Load specific `rules/*.md` files as needed
4. Do NOT load full `AGENTS.md` files (100KB+ context cost)
5. Follow skill rules relevant to your current task

This ensures project-specific patterns, conventions, and best practices are applied.
